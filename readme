Task Summary
Chose the Iris dataset, a popular multi-class classification dataset.

Normalized the feature set using StandardScaler to improve model performance.

Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification using sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.

Experimented with different values of K to observe the impact on accuracy and model behavior.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

Visualized decision boundaries using 2D feature pairs to understand the classifier's separation of classes.
